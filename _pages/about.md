I am a PhD student in Geographic Information Sciences at LASTIG, the research lab of the French National Mapping Agency. Fascinated by artificial intelligence, computer vision and keen on geography, I try to build efficient solutions to monitor the evolution of the territory from aerial images. I focus mainly on leveraging deep learning methods to detect changes in remote sensing data.
